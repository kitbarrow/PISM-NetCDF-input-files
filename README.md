# PISM-NetCDF-input-files
# This repository contains three code structures built to create netCDF-4 files compatible with the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM).
# These are designed to create the specific self-descibing structure required for PISM and to do so with minimal technical requirement.
# The files are all built with Python.

# The Python block code contains the base code used
# The Python interface file contains a file able to create a NetCDF file with no direct code contact needed
# The Jupyter Notebook Interface provides a more intuitive interface design
# All code requires a singular input DEM.
